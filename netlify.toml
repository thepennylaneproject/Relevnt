# âš™ï¸ NETLIFY CONFIGURATION
# =====================================================
# 
# This file configures how Netlify builds and deploys your site
# Place this in the ROOT of your project
# 
# ðŸŽ“ LEARNING NOTE:
# - [build] section: How to build your site
# - [functions] section: Serverless functions config
# - [[redirects]] section: URL routing rules
# 
# =====================================================

# =====================================================
# BUILD SETTINGS
# =====================================================

[build]
  # Command to build your React app
  command = "npm run build"
  
  # Directory containing the built files
  publish = "dist"
  
  # Directory containing serverless functions
  functions = "netlify/functions"

[build.environment]
# ðŸŽ“ Build Process:
# 1. Netlify runs: npm install
# 2. Then runs: npm run build (your command)
# 3. Deploys files from 'dist' folder
# 4. Makes functions available at /.netlify/functions/

# =====================================================
# FUNCTIONS SETTINGS
# =====================================================

[functions]
  # Node.js version for functions
  node_bundler = "esbuild"

  # Directory for functions (already set in [build] but can override)
  directory = "netlify/functions"

# =====================================================
# SCHEDULED FUNCTIONS
# =====================================================

# ðŸŽ“ Why esbuild?
# - Super fast bundler for serverless functions
# - Automatically includes dependencies
# - Smaller bundle sizes = faster cold starts

# Daily analytics summaries - runs daily at 2am UTC  
[functions."daily_summaries"]
  schedule = "0 2 * * *"

# Job alerts - runs daily at 9am UTC
[functions."job_alerts"]
  schedule = "0 9 * * *"

# Search queue processor - runs every 15 minutes for diverse, fresh job ingestion
[functions."search_queue_cron"]
  schedule = "*/15 * * * *"

# Jobs table cleanup - DISABLED until freshness tracking is fixed
# The cleanup was deleting jobs based on posted_date (original posting date)
# instead of last_seen_at (last ingestion date), causing table shrinkage.
# TODO: Re-enable after last_seen_at is added and upserts update it.
# [functions."cleanup_jobs-background"]
#   schedule = "0 3 * * *"

# ============================================
# HIGH-VOLUME JOB INGESTION SCHEDULES
# ============================================
# Optimized for maximum job volume (100K+ target)
# Run more frequently with higher pagination limits

# Premium sources - Greenhouse only (Lever moved to background function)
# Duration: <30 seconds | Potential: 1.5K+ jobs/day
[functions."ingest_premium_sources"]
  schedule = "*/30 * * * *"

# Lever background ingestion - runs every 30 minutes with 15-min timeout
# Duration: 30-60 seconds | Potential: 3.5K+ jobs/day
# Uses background function to handle large job volumes without timing out
[functions."ingest_lever-background"]
  schedule = "*/30 * * * *"

# Aggregators (remotive, himalayas, arbeitnow, etc.) - runs every 1 hour
# Duration: 5-10 minutes | Potential: 20K+ jobs/day
[functions."ingest_aggregators"]
  schedule = "0 * * * *"

# Remaining sources (usajobs, fantastic, etc.) - runs every 2 hours
# Duration: 5-10 minutes | Potential: 30K+ jobs/day (fantastic alone is 10M/month)
[functions."ingest_remaining_sources"]
  schedule = "0 */2 * * *"

# Ingestion healer - runs every 10 minutes for faster recovery
# Duration: <1 minute
[functions."ingestion_healer-background"]
  schedule = "*/10 * * * *"

# JobSpy web scraper - runs every 6 hours for intensive scraping (requires ts-jobspy)
# Duration: 30-60 seconds | Potential: 2K-5K jobs/day
# NOTE: Disabled by default - requires: npm install ts-jobspy
[functions."jobspy_ingest-background"]
  schedule = "0 */6 * * *"


# =====================================================
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (set in Netlify dashboard)
# =====================================================

# Don't put actual values here! Set them in:
# Netlify Dashboard â†’ Site settings â†’ Environment variables
#
# Required variables:
# - VITE_SUPABASE_URL
# - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (functions only, never frontend!)

# =====================================================
# REDIRECTS & REWRITES
# =====================================================

# SPA (Single Page Application) routing
# All routes should serve index.html for client-side routing
# This must NOT have conditions that prevent matching
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
  # force = false means if a file exists, serve it; else use this rule

# 🎓 Why this redirect?
# React Router (or similar) handles routing on client
# Without this, refreshing /jobs would return 404
# This serves index.html for all routes, then React Router takes over

# API routes are automatically handled at /.netlify/functions/*

# =====================================================
# HEADERS
# =====================================================

# Security headers for all pages
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    Permissions-Policy = "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()"

# ðŸŽ“ Security Headers Explained:
# - X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking (embedding site in iframe)
# - X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME type sniffing
# - X-XSS-Protection: Enables browser's XSS filter
# - Referrer-Policy: Controls referrer information
# - Permissions-Policy: Restricts browser features

# Cache static assets
[[headers]]
  for = "/assets/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

# ðŸŽ“ Cache-Control:
# - public: Can be cached by browsers and CDNs
# - max-age=31536000: Cache for 1 year (in seconds)
# - immutable: Content will never change
# Perfect for hashed assets (e.g., app.abc123.js)

# Don't cache HTML
[[headers]]
  for = "/*.html"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "no-cache"

# ðŸŽ“ Why no-cache for HTML?
# index.html should always be fresh
# It loads the hashed assets (which are cached)
# Ensures users always get latest app version

# =====================================================
# DEVELOPMENT SETTINGS
# =====================================================

[dev]
  # Netlify Dev main server (where you’ll open the browser)
  port = 8888

  # Let Netlify detect and run Vite on 5173
  # (no need to set frameworkPort explicitly unless it complains)

  autoLaunch = true

  # Functions server (Netlify will spin this up for functions)
  functionsPort = 9999
  
# ðŸŽ“ Local Development:
# Run: netlify dev
# - Starts your app on port 5173
# - Functions available at localhost:5173/.netlify/functions/
# - Loads environment variables from .env file

# =====================================================
# PLUGINS (OPTIONAL)
# =====================================================

# Example: Lighthouse plugin for performance monitoring
# [[plugins]]
#   package = "@netlify/plugin-lighthouse"
#
#   [plugins.inputs]
#     output_path = "reports/lighthouse.html"

# Example: Sitemap plugin
# [[plugins]]
#   package = "@netlify/plugin-sitemap"

# ðŸŽ“ Netlify Plugins:
# Extend build process with additional functionality
# Install with: npm install --save-dev @netlify/plugin-name
# Configure in this file
# Browse plugins: https://app.netlify.com/plugins

# =====================================================
# CONFIGURATION COMPLETE! âœ…
# =====================================================
# 
# ðŸŽ“ Next Steps:
# 1. Place this file in project root (next to package.json)
# 2. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
# 3. Connect GitHub repo to Netlify
# 4. Deploy!
# 
# Netlify will automatically:
# - Run npm install
# - Build your React app
# - Deploy to CDN
# - Set up serverless functions
# - Enable HTTPS
# - Give you a .netlify.app domain
#
