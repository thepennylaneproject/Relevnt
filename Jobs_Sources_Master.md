The truth about job pipelines in 2025

A single-source feed (or even three or four sources) creates a warped signal.
You get:

• too many contract jobs
• repeats
• stale posts
• biased listings
• missing industries
• missing senior roles
• missing global roles
• missing small-company roles

To build the anti-biased, sovereign job pipeline Relevnt deserves, we need wide coverage across:
	•	job boards
	•	company applicant tracking systems
	•	remote work aggregators
	•	niche verticals
	•	government labor datasets
	•	international markets
	•	skill-based, emerging-role datasets

Your sheet actually contains the exact starting point. And we can expand it dramatically.

The ideal pipeline strategy (practical + philosophical)

Here’s the direction I recommend based on scalability, legality, and signal strength:

Tier 1: Direct integrations (High Quality, High Signal)

These should be your core:

✓ LinkedIn Job Postings API
Very limited access, but if we get it, it becomes a backbone.

✓ Indeed API
You already got an API key. This is huge.

✓ CareerOneStop
Free, federal, stable, and huge coverage.

✓ USAJobs
Federal roles, consistent structure, high volume.

✓ Adzuna
Global coverage, structured APIs, includes salary insights.

✓ RemoteOK
You already have it wired.

✓ Remotive
Full remote feed, transparent docs.

✓ We Work Remotely (WWR)
Scrapable + structured.

These are your “always-on, sanity-check” sources.

Tier 2: Per-company ATS feeds

Think Greenhouse, Lever, Rippling, Workday.

These represent the long tail of actual corporate jobs that rarely hit aggregators.

Big upside:
We can ingest thousands of companies with almost no cost.

This layer brings in:
	•	tech
	•	healthcare
	•	education
	•	nonprofit
	•	entertainment
	•	manufacturing
	•	small business hiring

This is your diversity engine.

⸻

Tier 3: Specialized / niche / global feeds

This gives you coverage most job apps don’t have:
	•	Authentic Jobs (creative, design, dev)
	•	Behance Jobs
	•	TechInAsia Jobs
	•	EU remote job boards
	•	Arbeitnow (EU)
	•	Government datasets from UK, Australia, Canada

The goal is to avoid the American tech bias baked into most job tools.

⸻

Tier 4: Intelligence + skill signals

These aren’t job boards. They provide skill-to-job matching and emerging-role insights:
	•	Open Skills Project
	•	O*NET
	•	Lightcast
	•	DataAtWork
	•	ESCO skills taxonomy (EU)
	•	OECD emerging skill clusters

This layer makes Relevnt smarter than job boards because it lets us:
	1.	Predict upcoming roles.
	2.	Match users to jobs that aren’t obviously “in their lane”
	3.	Identify transferable skills
	4.	Build future-facing job maps
	5.	Highlight roles they didn’t know existed

This is where Relevnt becomes the anti-Indeed.

⸻

Tier 5: User-driven local job discovery (v3/v4 feature)

This is your “break the system” upgrade:

Allow users to connect:

✔ their local city’s economic dev job feeds
✔ local hospital/clinic careers
✔ school district job boards
✔ startups in their city
✔ municipal hiring pages

99 percent of job apps ignore local sourcing, but that’s where millions of jobs live.

This gives users real power.
